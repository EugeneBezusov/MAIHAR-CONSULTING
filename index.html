                        Before investing millions of dollars to fund an industrial process project, it is essential to develop a good understanding 
                        of the costs and risks. It’s here <span class="bold-text">WE HELP.</span> We utilize industry leading practices to analyze complex investment structures\ 
                        and operating environments to deliver technical assessment and due diligence services such as:

                    <ul >
                        <li>Is the design basis strong or weak?</li>
                        <li>Is the design information accurate?</li>
                        <li>Were sound process engineering principals used throughout the design?</li>
                        <li>Is the process likely to produce the material yield and quality claimed?</li>
                        <li>Are effluent and emissions estimates realistic and have proper environmental control systems been included?</li>
                        <li>Have all facets of the process received due consideration or have any important issues been oversimplified or not considered at all?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="mc-swo__title">Existing Operations Evaluation of Active or Mothballed Facilities</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When the purchase of an operational or shut down plant is being considered, we can assist by
                            providing valuable assessment of the operations and equipment. This is done by reviewing key
                            information, inspecting the plant site, and interviewing the plant&#39;s staff. We design information,
                            equipment documents, P&amp;IDs, standard operating procedures, and operating data. If the plant is
                            operating we visit the site to tour the facility and witness the condition of the equipment and
                            operations first hand. We also interview plant management, engineering staff, operators, and
                            maintenance personnel to get an idea of how the operation is being run and what major issues
                            they currently face. Our engineers have years of in-plant operations experience which is
                            invaluable when assessing a production facility operation.</li>

                        <li>If project plans call for the redevelopment of a Brownfield site (where a plant has been mothballed
                            or partially dismantled), we will review the available plant documentation and past operating data,
                            as well as provide an on-site process assessment of the equipment and facilities. If plans include
                            use of the facility for other than its original design intent, we will evaluate the extent to which the
                            existing equipment can be used &#39;as-is&#39; or in a modified form. A realistic view of the challenges and
                            gaps that exist between what is being purchased and what needs to be done to achieve the
                            process goals is developed. Both high-level and detailed plans can be developed regarding the process changes
                             that may be required, as well as generating a cost estimate to implement these
                            changes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="mc-swo__title">Process Design Risk Assessment</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is the design basis complete?</li>
                        <li>If the process is being scaled up from a smaller version: </li>
                        <li>Is the laboratory or pilot-test data sufficient to confidently predict performance of the larger process or are more data needed?</li>
                        <li>Was equipment scale-up performed properly?</li>
                        <li>Is there enough margin and operational / control flexibility in the design to allow for process optimization after startup? </li>
                        <li>Has raw material or intermediate feed stream cleaning / preparation / conditioning been adequately addressed?</li>
                        <li>Have sensitivity analyses been run on key parts of the process to understand the effects on process parameters that are likely to vary?</li>
                        <li>Have process effluent and emissions been accounted for and mitigation systems correctly designed?</li>
                        <li>Is the process equipment selected likely to be reliable and what are the expected maintenance needs to keep it running?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="mc-swo__title">Independent Cost Estimation</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We routinely develop Total Installed Cost estimates for processes. These range in accuracy from an Order of 
                                Magnitude (+/- 100%) to +25%/-10% depending on how detailed the process design has been developed. 
                                We work with equipment vendors to obtain purchased cost estimates and then use industrial project cost ind
                                exes and factors (labor, electrical, structural, civil, etc.) to develop a factored cost estimate. We can independently 
                                develop such cost estimates for clients as a way of validating the cost estimates prepared by others. Significant 
                                differences between cost estimates can quickly point to items that may not have been adequately addressed in 
                                either the design, the cost estimate, or both.</li>

                        We have the insight to deliver sound, independent and actionable analysis with confidence and are recognized for our
                        integrity, objectivity, independence and professionalism.  We have developed our expertise through years of deep 
                        industry experience in engineering and procurement, operations, technology evaluation and feasibility analysis, regulatory
                        compliance and consulting. For each client, we start a dialogue to make sure primary concerns are 
                        completely understood. Our experience enables us to understand “the big picture” for every due diligence review. 
                        We also don’t believe in a one-size-fits-all approach. That’s why we customize each review based on our client’s needs, 
                        scope and objective.

                    We are respectful towards our competition, but we have heard from our clients many reasons why they choose us.
                </p>
                <p><span class="bold-text">&#183; Compared to local Excel or Access consultants:</span><br>
                Consultants with this business model typically need a higher per client revenue to sustain their operation. The total cost using us could end up being 1/3 to 1/2 what a local consultant would charge. You should use them only if you have a very large budget, or you have strict corporate policy against outside vendors.</p>
                <p><span class="bold-text">&#183; Compared to other Remote Excel or Access Consultants:</span><br>
                We are sized just right. We are big enough that our consultant team can collaborate on tough problems and occasionally scale our operation to deliver large projects quickly. We don't do this on the side to augment a full time job or a large, primary client. We also are not too big such that your project gets ignored or gets shuffled to a junior employee or outsourced. If a salesperson or "project manager" is your primary contact, then you are not getting the focus you deserve.</p>
                <p><span class="bold-text">&#183; Compared to Off-shore Resources:</span><br>
                    If you have a lot of time, and a very small budget, and are developing something that is not mission critical, and have had success in the past with off-shore resources, then this might be a good idea. But many clients have expressed frustration with their past experiences. They usually call us in to save the day after a long cycle of miscommunication, delays, and buggy product.</p>
                <p><span class="bold-text">&#183; Compared to In-House Resources</span><br>
                    Our consultants all worked for companies doing the same kind of work before becoming consultants. There is rarely enough consistent need for a dedicated resource with our skillset and efficiency to justify a full time position. We automate analytical and reporting processes and turn full time $100K positions into a $1,000/mo consulting contract for maintenance and updates.</p>
